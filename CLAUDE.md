# BigBase — Claude Code

Read CONVENTIONS.md before any GitHub or git operation.

## Project
Single-binary, component-based BaaS platform using Entity-Component-Construct (ECC) architecture.
Stack: Go 1.22+ / ECC Kernel + Plugins / SQLite + PostgreSQL

## Commands
| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Run    | `go run .` |
| Test   | `go test ./...` |
| Build  | `go build -o bigbase .` |
| Lint   | `golangci-lint run ./...` |
| Test coverage | `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./... && go tool cover -func=coverage.out` |

## Architecture
ECC pattern: Kernel (discovery, lifecycle, event bus, config merge) + pluggable components (proxy, auth, db, api, storage, git, forge, cici, functions, realtime, messaging, deploy, admin, monitoring). Components communicate via event hooks, not direct imports.

## Conventions
- Go standard layout: `kernel/`, `components/<name>/`, `config/`
- Component interface: `Init(ctx, config) → Start(ctx) → Stop(ctx)`
- Event bus for cross-component communication (no direct imports)
- TDD workflow: write test first, see it fail, implement, verify green
- All planning output in `specs/`

## Never
- Hardcode secrets, API keys, or tokens
- Mutate state directly — use spread/immutable patterns
- Commit to main without PR
- Expose internal errors or stack traces to API clients
- Use `any` in Go — prefer concrete types or interfaces

## Agent Rules
- Read specs/ before writing code.
- All planning and specifications MUST be written to `specs/` before code.
- Write minimum code that solves the stated problem.
- Run tests after every change. Show evidence before declaring done.
