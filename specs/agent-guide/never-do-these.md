# NEVER Do These

source: AGENTS.md

### NEVER Do These
- NEVER edit a function without first calling `get_blast_radius` on it
- NEVER skip `get_why_context` — reverted code and anti-patterns are invisible without it
- NEVER grep source files to find symbols when `search_symbols` exists
- NEVER manually trace imports when `find_importers` gives the full reverse dependency graph
